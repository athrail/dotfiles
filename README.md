# Dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repo.
Inspired by [@typecraft_dev](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev) and his
method for organization of dotfiles.

This assumes repo is cloned to `$HOME` (i.e. "$HOME/.dotfiles") and from inside after installation of `GNU stow` it can be called i.e.

```bash
> stow fish
```

For setting up dotfiles for fish.
